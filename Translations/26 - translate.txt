"He said," "Indra, the king of the gods, who had the best of the horses in his chariot, after this worship by Kadru, hid the sky with blue clouds."

He commanded the clouds, saying, Let your water jar down, please, that I may take a drink, and who will indeed say, Take a drink, and I shall also water your camels, this is the one you must assign to your servant, to the sons of Israel.

The sky appeared to be abuzz with clouds of wonderful, fear-inspiring thunders and an endless stream of water, the sound of the waves, the sounds of the clouds, the lightnings, the rumbling of the wind, and the thundering of the clouds.

The entire sky was covered with clouds, and the sun and the moon's rays completely disappeared due to incessant rains.

The snakes were very happy because of Indra's rain.

The earth was filled with water, and clear, cool water flowed down to the surface.

The whole earth was covered with countless surges of water, and the serpents and their mothers came to the lovely island of Lamu
