The Saudis said the snakes, soaked in the rain, were very amused after that

The bird with those beautiful feathers quickly reached the island to carry themselves

The island, the location of the Capricorns, was determined by the creation of the universe

There they saw a terrible salty ocean

Those who came with Garuda realized that there was a beautiful forest washed by the water in the lap of the sea and the melody of feathered musicians was everywhere.

There, the clusters of trees were full of flowers and fruits

There were also beautiful mansions and lots of lotus ponds

There were many lakes with clean water

Excitement prevailed there with the creeping fresh-smelling breeze

There were many trees that grew only on the Malay hills and their heights were sky high

In many more trees, their flowers fell off and spread beautifully with the help of the breeze

Thus the forest was beautiful and always pleasing and desirable to the Ganders

It was full of beetles that ate wine from the flowers

All of these scenes brought great joy

For many reasons the forest was pleasing to all, beautiful and sacred

Echoing the melodies of many birds, it brought joy to Kadru's sons-in-law

The snakes came to the forest and spent their time happily

To the mighty blind man, the king of birds, to take us to some other beautiful, clean water island.

They ordered that since you did not fly, you would have seen a lot of beautiful places while flying like that

After thinking for a while with Garu, his mother asked, "Mother, why should I fulfill all the orders of these snakes?" He asked

To this son, who is astronaut, full of all virtues, and of great power and strength, O best of birds, I am enslaved to my chaklati by my evil.

The astronaut was so distressed when he heard his mother say that the snakes cheated, defeated the race, and put me in this situation. We will be freed from slavery, he said

The Saudis continued, "Snakes who heard this, bring the elixir by your strength."

O bird then you will be freed from your bondage
