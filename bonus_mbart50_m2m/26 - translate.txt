And Shaoud said, After that the goddess Indra, who had the best of horses in his land, had been obedient to Gathru, he covered the heavens with blue clouds,

He proclaimed to the people, ‘Spend your holy sperm, not to be produced.’ And the clouds gave light with the lightning, and poured out a great rain, one upon another in the air, without any hindrance.

And the heaven appeared as the end of the age, with the clouds of wonder, and of tremendous glory, and continually pouring out great abundance of water. And with the great rain the waves appeared, and with the rains, and with the wings of the clouds, and with the lights of the lightning, and with the hardness of the wind, and with the trembling of the wind, as if the air were taken captive.

The whole sky was covered with clouds. The moon and the moon's wings disappeared completely due to an uninterrupted storm.

When the storm hit Indra, the monkeys were delighted.

The earth was filled with water, and clear, cool water poured down to the bottom.

And the earth was surrounded by a multitude of waves. The monkeys and their mother and the Ramayanaman were caught in the fire.'
