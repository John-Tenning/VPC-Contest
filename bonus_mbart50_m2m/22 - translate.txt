He said to them, "If you do not know what you are doing, you will not be able to do it, and if you do not know what you are doing, you will not be able to do it, and if you do not know what you are doing, you will be able to do it."

 On the other hand, they said, "We shall shatter the horse's tail, if she has mercy on them, so that she may deliver them from the curse."

 It is said that the monkeys then turned into the ends of the horse's mouth. The two ships, the best of the Brahmins, the daughters of Dakshin and the sisters of Katru and Vinathai, who had built the bridge, hurried out of the air to see the sea.

As they proceeded, they saw the water, which was not easy to shake, suddenly shaken by a strong wind and burning with tears. And the great fishes, and the great beasts, which swallowed the fishes,

Thousands of different kinds of creatures, terrible animals, inaccessible and terrible, a mine of blood of all kinds, the house of Varuna, the dwelling place of the serpents, the kingdom of all the rivers,

A dwelling place for fire in the earth, a dwelling place for the unclean, a dwelling place for all the abominations of the living creatures;

Let it be marvelous without wearyness, and marvelous, and a fountain of the riches of God, and of no measure, and of no wisdom, and of holy water:

And they saw the sea, full of thousands of great rivers, till the edge of the sea, where the waves were poured out.

And the two brethren of the sea, who were about to make a pilgrimage, were as wide as the skies, and as deep, and as darkened by the fire of the earth: and they passed by swiftly.
