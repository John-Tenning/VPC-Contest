"The king said," "Indra, the king of the gods, who had the best of the horses on his chariot, after being worshiped like this by Kadru, hid the sky with blue clouds and instructed the gods to sprinkle your holy drops, which could not give life to the living beings." ""
The clouds glistened with lightning and thunder, and the sky was filled with rain
The amazing, awe - inspiring, and continual watering of the clouds made it look like the end of the age
The rain caused the waves to be accompanied by strong winds, thunder, lightning, and thunder
The sky was overcast with clouds
The sun and the moon disappeared completely due to incessant rains
Snakes were delighted by the rain of Indra
The earth is filled with water, clear and cool water flowing down to the bottom
The earth was surrounded by countless tidal waves
Snakes and their mother reached the island of Ramayagamen
